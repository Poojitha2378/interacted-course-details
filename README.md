#Agentic AI Product Execution: From Strategy to Launch
A practical guide for AI Product Managers

##Chapter 1: Translating AI Strategy into Delivery
Adapting Agile for Agentic AI Product Development
###Lesson 1: Why Traditional Agile Falls Short for Agentic AI Products
The uncertainty paradox: unpredictable model performance vs. sprint commitments
Research spikes vs. feature sprints
Defining "done" when accuracy is probabilistic
###Lesson 2: Hybrid Agile-Research Workflows
Two-track development: research cycles + engineering sprints
Sprint planning with experimentation buffers
Success metrics beyond velocity (model performance gates, user value milestones)
###Lesson 3: Story Mapping for Agentic AI Features
Writing user stories for ML-powered features
Acceptance criteria that account for model uncertainty
Prioritization frameworks: RICE for Agentic AI (incorporating technical feasibility)
###Lesson 4: Release Planning with Model Iterations
MVP thresholds for Agentic AI features (what accuracy is "good enough"?)
Phased rollouts and shadow deployments
Planning for model retraining and drift
