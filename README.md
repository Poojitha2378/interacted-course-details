# Agentic AI Product Execution: From Strategy to Launch
A practical guide for AI Product Managers

## [Chapter 1: Translating AI Strategy into Delivery](https://github.com/Poojitha2378/interacted-course-details/blob/main/ai-product-management-lessons/overview.md)
Adapting Agile for Agentic AI Product Development

### [Lesson 1: Why Traditional Agile Falls Short for Agentic AI Products](https://github.com/Poojitha2378/interacted-course-details/blob/main/ai-product-management-lessons/ai_pm_lesson1.md)

- The uncertainty paradox: unpredictable model performance vs. sprint commitments
- Research spikes vs. feature sprints
- Defining "done" when accuracy is probabilistic

### [Lesson 2: Hybrid Agile-Research Workflows](https://github.com/Poojitha2378/interacted-course-details/blob/main/ai-product-management-lessons/ai_pm_lesson2.md)

- Two-track development: research cycles + engineering sprints
- Sprint planning with experimentation buffers
- Success metrics beyond velocity (model performance gates, user value milestones)

### [Lesson 3: Story Mapping for Agentic AI Features](https://github.com/Poojitha2378/interacted-course-details/blob/main/ai-product-management-lessons/ai_pm_lesson3.md)

- Writing user stories for ML-powered features
- Acceptance criteria that account for model uncertainty
- Prioritization frameworks: RICE for Agentic AI (incorporating technical feasibility)

### [Lesson 4: Release Planning with Model Iterations](https://github.com/Poojitha2378/interacted-course-details/blob/main/ai-product-management-lessons/ai_pm_lesson4.md)

- MVP vs. MEP: Different Product Approaches for Different AI Types (what accuracy is "good enough"?)
- Phased rollouts and shadow deployments
- Planning for model retraining and drift
