# Chapter 1: Translating AI Strategy into Delivery
## Adapting Agile for Agentic AI Product Development

### Chapter Overview
Traditional Agile methodologies were designed for deterministic software development—where inputs produce predictable outputs, code behaves consistently, and "done" has a clear definition. Agenti...

**The Critical Distinction:**
As a traditional PM, you gather requirements and build features. As an AI PM, you **frame problems in ways that are solvable with data and models**. You don't just define features—you define acce...

This chapter equips you with hybrid frameworks that preserve Agile's collaborative strengths while addressing AI's inherent uncertainty, drawing from proven patterns used by companies like GitHub [...]

**Learning Objectives:**
- Recognize why traditional Agile practices fail for AI products and where they need adaptation
- Understand the different AI product lifecycles (AI/ML, GenAI, Agentic AI) and when to use each
- Design two-track workflows that balance research experimentation with engineering delivery
- Write user stories and acceptance criteria that account for model uncertainty
- Plan releases with model iterations, shadow deployments, and drift management

**AI PM Mindset Prerequisite:**
Before diving into Agile adaptations, internalize this: **Launch is the beginning, not the milestone**. Traditional software ships and stabilizes. AI products ship and evolve. Models degrade, data[...]
